            <p class="article">After the release of her seventh studio album, Unapologetic, (2012) and her fifth concert tour, the Diamonds World Tour, 
                Rihanna went on a hiatus. Between 2005 and 2012, Rihanna released or re-released at least one album a year. However, in 2013, 
                Rihanna took a step back from music and did not release a new album that year or the following. 
                Instead Rihanna opted to take part in other endeavors, starring in a 3D animated film entitled Home, alongside Jim Parsons, 
                Steve Martin and Jennifer Lopez, as well as executively producing its accompanying soundtrack.
                In a review for The New York Times, Jon Caramanica stated that Rihanna was at her 
                "most confident" and "the most present she's ever been onstage", calling her dancing "casual" and that 
                she "appeared to be finding joy in singing — when she was doing it." Reviewing the Los Angeles concert, 
                Latifah Muhammad from VIBE described the tour as a "randomly epic road trip.</p>

            <p class="article_hiden">In November 2015, it was announced that Rihanna had signed a $25 million contract with Samsung to not only 
                promote Samsung's Galaxy line of products, but to also sponsor the release of Anti and its supporting tour.
                On November 23, 2015, Rihanna announced she would be embarking on "The Anti World Tour". 
                The Samsung-sponsored tour began in March 2016, with Travis Scott supporting in North America, 
                and Big Sean and DJ Mustard supporting at selected European dates.
                Ed Power from The Telegraph gave Dublin concert four stars, writing that the tour 
                "didn't waste time on embellishments and instead delivered full-strength shots of sass and escapism."
                The London concert also received four stars from The Guardian, where Michael Cragg praised the singer's 
                "unshakeable Rihanna-ness; that perfect pop voice, the undeniable presence, that couldn't-give-a-shit attitude."
